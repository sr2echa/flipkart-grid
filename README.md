## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the System
```bash
# Start the Flask web application
python autosuggest/app.py
```

### 3. Access the Web Interface
Open your browser and go to: `http://localhost:5000`

## 🎯 Usage

### Web Interface
1. **Basic Search**: Type in the search box to get real-time suggestions
2. **Context Settings**: 
   - Set your location (e.g., "Mumbai", "Delhi")
   - Choose events (e.g., "Diwali", "IPL", "Wedding")
   - Add session context (previous searches)
3. **Example Queries**: Click example buttons to test different scenarios

### Example Queries to Test
- **Gaming**: "gaming" → suggests "gaming laptop", "gaming mouse"
- **Sports**: "jersey" → suggests "cricket jersey", "ipl jersey"
- **Formal Wear**: "formal" → suggests "formal shirt", "formal shoes"
- **Typo Correction**: "laptap" → suggests "laptop"
- **Brands**: "samsung" → suggests "smartphone", "gaming laptop"
- **Generic**: "wireless headphones" → suggests "wireless earbuds", "headphones"

## 🔍 Technical Details

### **Data Preprocessing**
- Handles missing values and data cleaning
- Concatenates text fields for better semantic understanding
- Extracts major categories and locations
- Generates synthetic data for comprehensive coverage

### **Autosuggest Components**

#### 1. **Trie Component**
- Builds Trie from user queries with frequency data
- Performs efficient prefix matching
- Sorts by frequency (descending)

#### 2. **Semantic Correction**
- Uses SBERT (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) for embeddings
- FAISS for efficient similarity search
- Handles typo correction and semantic similarity
- Eliminates duplicate suggestions

#### 3. **BERT Completion**
- Uses DistilBERT for masked language modeling
- Generates context-aware completions
- Combines with predefined e-commerce patterns

#### 4. **XGBoost Reranker**
- Trains on multiple features:
  - Frequency of suggestion
  - Semantic similarity score
  - Session history relevance
  - Contextual boost
  - Predicted conversion rate
- Normalizes scores to 0-1 range

### **Contextual Features**
- **Location Boost**: Mumbai-specific suggestions, Delhi preferences
- **Event Boost**: Diwali, IPL, Wedding season suggestions
- **Session Context**: Previous queries, clicked products
- **Real-time Integration**: Current product availability and trends

## 🎨 UI Features

### **Minimalistic Design**
- Clean, monochrome interface
- Real-time suggestions as you type
- Contextual settings panel
- Example query buttons for testing
- Score display for transparency

### **Responsive Layout**
- Works on desktop and mobile
- Fast loading and smooth interactions
- Clear suggestion display with scores

## 🧪 Testing

Run the test script to verify all fixes:
```bash
python autosuggest/test_fixes.py
```

This will test all the problematic queries and show the results.

## 🔧 Configuration

### **Model Settings**
- SBERT Model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- BERT Model: `distilbert-base-uncased`
- FAISS Index: Cosine similarity
- XGBoost: 100 estimators, max_depth=6

### **Scoring Parameters**
- Semantic similarity threshold: 0.3
- Frequency boost multiplier: 1.5
- Contextual boost range: 0.1-0.3
- Session relevance weight: 0.2

## 🚀 Performance
